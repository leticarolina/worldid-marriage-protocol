## Introduction

marriagePROOF enables two verified humans to get married on chain.  In addition to providing 'Proof of Marriage', marriagePROOF provides the operating environment for what is essentially is a two-person DAO: common treasury, governance and on-chain history.

## Features

- **Automated Marriage Proposal and Acceptance** Turning getting married into a few clicks, minting a commemorative NFT upon marriage.
- **Joint Treasury Management** Easing the process of earning and managing money in a joint account. Income automatically split, with single-signature maximum and multi-sig minimum.
- **Smart Marriage Registry** Immutable, decentralized, privacy-preserving registry of married World IDs that any dating app (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, etc.) can query with one API call.
- **Instant Divorce** Simplifying and reducing costs of the divorcing process. And eliminating lawyers!
