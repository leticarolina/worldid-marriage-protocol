## Introduction

HumanBond allows two verified humans (via World ID) to form a cryptographically provable bond on-chain.

A marriage becomes:

- A legal-fiction on-chain registry entry, and
- A two-person DAO with shared treasury, shared yield, and a permanent relationship history.

With one proposal → one acceptance → a couple immediately receives:

- A dynamic Vow NFT
- Annual Milestone NFTs
- TIME token yield for each day spent together

The protocol handles everything autonomously: proposals, acceptance, yield, shared treasury, on-chain history, and divorce.

## Smart Contracts

### World Chain Mainnet

- **Human Bond (Core Engine)**: [0x439f09efB4993A4Ee039ccf65e69CF3CC705D735](https://worldscan.org/address/0x439f09efB4993A4Ee039ccf65e69CF3CC705D735)
- **Vow Dynamic Onchain NFT**: [0xED8f02196B1884657A8c3d17a516c2eEfcc3E2e1](https://worldscan.org/address/0xED8f02196B1884657A8c3d17a516c2eEfcc3E2e1)
- **Milestone Upgradeable NFT**: 
[0xb12F9Ef0aF10a035B18BC00A26219c335111d587](https://worldscan.org/address/0xb12F9Ef0aF10a035B18BC00A26219c335111d587)
- **TIME Token**:
[0x1493BF2c2762b5C991835c63683bBBcD14C3cC43](https://worldscan.org/address/0x1493BF2c2762b5C991835c63683bBBcD14C3cC43)

### Contract Responsibilities

**HumanBond.sol** → Core logic: proposals, marriage activation, divorce, yield, milestones.

**VowNFT.sol** → Dynamic metadata NFT minted once per partner at marriage.

**MilestoneNFT.sol** → Upgradeable NFT collection that tracks yearly anniversaries.

**TimeToken.sol** → ERC-20 reward token generated by shared time in marriage.

## Protocol Overview

Core Lifecycle and Main Functions:

**1. Proposal**

> propose(address proposed, root, nullifier, proof)

- World ID verification
- Stores an outgoing proposal;
- Adds proposer to the recipient’s incoming list;
- Prevents spam & multi-proposals;
- Prevents marriage if either address is already married;
- Only one-time nullifier use;

**2. Acceptance**

> accept(proposer, root, nullifier, proof)

- Creates a marriage with:
- Deterministic marriage ID
- Two dynamic Vow NFTs
- Initial TIME token reward (1 to each partner)
- All proposals cleared
- Activates marriage;

**3. Daily Yield**

Couples earn:
1 TIME token per day together (shared reward).

> claimYield(partner)

Splits the accumulated TIME tokens 50/50

**4. Milestones (“Memories”)**

> manualCheckAndMint(partner)

- Mints yearly anniversary NFT(s)
- Supports minting “missed years” in one call
- Uses MilestoneNFT to determine available years

**5. Divorce**

> divorce(partner)

- Auto-mints pending yield
- Marks marriage inactive
- Frees both partners to remarry
- Deletes no historical data (preserves relationship-proof)

## Refactoring from Hackaton to v2

V2 is a ground-up improvement aimed at reliability, gas-efficiency, and frontend simplicity

### Clean architecture

- Efficient incoming proposal indexing
- Efficient outgoing proposal tracking
- O(1) storage removal of proposals
- Deterministic marriage ID for easy lookups
- Proposal cancellation
- Deterministic marriage IDs upon marriage
- Direct UI-ready getter functions

### NFT & Token Logic Upgrades

- Dynamic Vow NFT metadata
- Milestone NFT with upgradeable registry of years
- Catch-up minting for anniversaries

### World ID Integration

- Separate external nullifiers for proposing & accepting
- Anti-replay nullifier tracking per action
- HumanBond integrates with the World ID Router contract.
- As only Orb credentials are supported on-chain, all proof verifications use groupId = 1
